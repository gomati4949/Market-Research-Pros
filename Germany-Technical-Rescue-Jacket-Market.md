The first category includes thermal jackets, which are specifically designed to offer protection in extreme cold conditions. These jackets are equipped with advanced insulation materials to ensure warmth during operations in freezing temperatures. Additionally, these jackets often feature high-visibility colors and reflective elements to enhance the visibility of rescue personnel in low-light environments. The demand for thermal jackets is driven by the increasing frequency of rescue operations in winter or mountainous terrains where maintaining body temperature is critical for the safety of rescue teams and victims alike.</p><p>The second category includes waterproof and breathable rescue jackets, which are essential for operations in wet or humid environments. These jackets are constructed with specialized fabrics that prevent water penetration while allowing perspiration to escape, keeping rescue personnel dry and comfortable. They are commonly used in flood zones, water-based rescues, or during heavy rain, where durability and water resistance are paramount. With the rise in unpredictable weather patterns, there is a growing need for jackets that can provide both comfort and protection against the elements, making waterproof jackets a significant segment in the market.
